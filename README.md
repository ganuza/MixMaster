# MixMaster

### Deployed Link


### **ABSTRACT**
Bartenders and cocktail fans will be excited to have this useful app on hand as they look for drink recipes based on a spirit they have on hand.
This Showcase project was assigned as part of Turing School of Software Design Module 3 Front End curriculum.  Our task was to design an app and implement all of the technologies we have been learning over the course of the last 5 weeks. MixMaster makes network requests to TheCocktailDB api to access cocktail data and recipe data in response to user input.  A user can select a spirit to get a listing of cocktails that include that spirit.  Clicking on a chevron of a particular cocktail card reveals the recipe and instructions for how to make it.
